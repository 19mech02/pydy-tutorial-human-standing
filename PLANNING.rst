Folks Involved
==============

- Jason: will be at MSASB and PyCon and is leading the charge on this. I'm
  planning to be the main presenter of the tutorial (especially if I'm the only
  one there!).
- Tarun: We are trying to get funding for Tarun to come to PYCON, but he will
  be helping prepare regardless.
- Gilbert: Is going to try to attend PYCON and will be helping prepare.
- Obinna (grad student in Jason's lab): Is going to attend MASB and probably
  PYCON and will be helping prepare.
- Chris: Probably not coming but said he could help out in preparation.

Goals
=====

- The MASB version of the tutorial should be accessible to graduate students
  (and above) in biomechanical engineering related fields.
- The PYCON version of the tutorial must be accesible to people that have
  general technical degrees (not necessarily engineering). Many will be
  computer scientists, some will be makers/hackers, and others will be
  scientists of various backgrounds that are strong in programming skills. Most
  people will have good software development skills.
- We'd like to give people a way to model basic systems, understand their
  motion through simulation/visualization, and maybe allow them to control
  their system.
- We'd like to the students to complete an example problem that relates
  somewhat to the hacker/maker robotics world. This could be a robot arm, and
  RC car, or a heli/quad-copter, etc. Note: We are going to give the tutorial
  at a Biomechanics meeting in Akron on March 4th so I'm heavily leaning to a
  biomechanical influenced example problem that is applicable to robotics too.
- Software installation on all platforms should work (and we need VirtualBox or
  Wakari backup plans in case it doesn't).
- The tutorial must fit into 2 hours and 45 minutes.
